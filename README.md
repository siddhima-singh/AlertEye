# ALERT EYE: Motion Detection System üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

## Objective

The ALERT EYE project aims to detect motion using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor to identify changes in infrared radiation emitted by humans or animals within its field of view. This system can trigger alerts or initiate predefined actions, making it highly applicable for security systems, automated lighting, and real-time monitoring.

## Problem Statement

With growing safety and security concerns, constant vigilance in sensitive areas like homes, offices, and restricted zones is impractical. Existing solutions often suffer from:
- High costs and energy inefficiency.
- Frequent false alarms due to sensitivity issues.
- Limited adaptability to dynamic environments.

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a reliable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient motion detection system using a PIR sensor and Raspberry Pi 3.

## Hardware Components
1. **Raspberry Pi 3**  
   - Features: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, 1GB RAM, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPIO pins.
   - Purpose: Acts as the central processing unit for interfacing with the PIR sensor and executing motion detection logic.

2. **PIR Sensor (e.g., HC-SR501)**  
   - Function: Detects motion by sensing infrared radiation changes from moving objects like humans or animals.
   - Integration: Connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for real-time data input.

3. **LED Indicators**  
   - Purpose: Visual feedback upon detecting motion.

4. **Notification System**  
   - Alerts via phone or PC screen using pre-configured scripts.
